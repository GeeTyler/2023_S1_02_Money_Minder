individuals often find it challenging to keep track of their purchases, investments, and overall financial health. Recognizing this problem,

primary objective was to simplify the process of managing finances for individuals. By integrating various financial functions into a single 
web application, we aimed to streamline the entire process and eliminate the need for users to navigate multiple platforms. This innovative 
solution not only benefits individuals but also serves as a powerful tool for big companies to efficiently manage their receipts.
